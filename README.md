# Api Client Starter-Kit

This open-source library is provided for cases where you need to do APIs calls with large flexibility that officials SDK may not provide out-of-the-box. When using this Starter-Kit, you will be able to make better cURL requests with a smart managing of requests and responses.

## Installation

### Composer

1. At you console, in your project folder, type `composer require piggly/php-api-client`;
2. Don't forget to add Composer's autoload file at your code base `require_once('vendor/autoload.php);`.

### Manual install

1. Download or clone with repository with `git clone https://github.com/piggly-dev/php-api-client.git`;
2. After, goes to `cd /path/to/piggly/php-api-client`;
3. Install all Composer's dependencies with `composer install`;
4. Add project's autoload file at your code base `require_once('/path/to/piggly/php-api-client/vendor/autoload.php);`.

## Dependencies 

The library has the following external dependencies:

* [PHP cURL extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php);
* [PHP JSON extension](https://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php);
* PHP 7.2+.

## How to?

### Configuration

This library provides, first, a `Configuration` object. You must create it before send any request. You may create many `Configuration` objects to provide different environments or you could use `.env` files to manages it.

See below all configurations:

Configuration | Method | Description
--- | --- | ---
Api Keys | `apiKey()` and `getApiKey()` | Add a new api key. You may have many.
Access Token | `accessToken()` and `getAccessToken()` | Add an access token.
Client Username | `username()` and `getUsername()` | HTTP Client Username to Basic Authentication.
Client Password | `password()` and `getPassword()` | HTTP Client Secret to Basic Authentication.
HTTP Headers | `headers()` and `cloneHeaders()` | Manage the defaults HTTP Headers.
Host | `host()` and `getHost()` | Host URL to send Requests, without paths.
UserAgent | `userAgent()` and `getUserAgent()` | UserAgent which is making Requestes.
Timeout | `timeout()` and `getTimeout()` | The maximum number of seconds to allow cURL functions to execute.
Connection Timeout | `connectionTimeout()` and `getConnectionTimeout()` | The maximum amount of time in seconds that is allowed to make the connection to the server
Proxy Host | `proxyHost()` and `getProxyHost()` | Host for proxying.
Proxy Port | `proxyPort()` and `getProxyPort()` | Port for proxying.
Proxy Type | `proxyType()` and `getProxyType()` | cURL proxy type, e.g. CURLPROXY_HTTP or CURLPROXY_SOCKS5.
Proxy User | `proxyUser()` and `getProxyUser()` | User for proxying.
Proxy Password | `proxyPassword()` and `getProxyPassword()` | Password for proxying.
Custom Configuration | `custom()` and `getCustom()` | Add any custom configuration.
SSL Validation | `verifySSL()` and `shouldVerifySSL()` | If should or not do a SSL verification.
Default Configuration | `default` and `getDefault()` | A static default configuration objects. It will be available to all Configuration instances.

Development configurations:

With `debug()` method you will be able to enable requests debugging. You also may set a `Logger` to log messages across code lifetime. The `logger()` method is expecting a `Logger` from `monolog/monolog` package. Only when a `Logger` is set the `log()` method will output messages into `Logger`.

> **NOTE**: Debug messages will only be output to `Logger` when `debug()` mode is active.

You can also control configurations by usign `.env` files with `env()` method. You must set then the `path` where `.env` file is located and the current `env`. When `env` is `dev`, `Configuration` object will try to get `.env.dev` file at your `path`. The `.env` variables are:

```
CURL_CLIENT_USERNAME=username
CURL_CLIENT_PASSWORD=password
CURL_DEBUG=true
CURL_HTTP_HOST=http://localhost
CURL_HTTP_USER_AGENT=MyServer/1.0
CURL_HTTP_TIMEOUT=60
CURL_HTTP_CONN_TIMEOUT=60
CURL_PROXY_HOST=proxy://localhost
CURL_PROXY_PORT=5050
CURL_PROXY_USER=proxyusername
CURL_PROXY_PASSWORD=proxypassword
```

> See at [.env.example](.env.example) to see an example.

### Requests

After configuration is done, you are ready to use `Request` object. You may set a `Configuration` object to `Request` constructor or it will get the default configuration.

Then, you must start with request's methods: `delete()`, `head()`, `get()`, `options()`, `patch()`,`post()` and `put()`. After you will be able to manipulate request with methods below:

Method | Description
--- | ---
`headers()` | Manages all request headers.
`applyHeaders()` | Applies headers to request headers.
`basicAuth()` | Apply basic authorization header.
`authorization()` | Apply authorization header with an api key.
`data()` | Set the post data.
`params()` | Set parameters replaces to URI. At URI, `/posts/{id}` you may set `params(['id', 1])`, then it will be replaced `/posts/1`.
`query()` | Set query string parameters.
`responseType()` | Set the response type as `\SplFileObject`, `string` or `array`.

When your request is done, you need to use `call()` method. The `call()` method will:

* Throw an `ApiResponseException`, if response fails;
* Throw an `ApiResponseException`, if response has a non 2xx response;
* Return an `array` in format `[$body, $httpCode, $headers]` which you can handle with `list($body, $httpCode, $headers) = $request->call();`.

#### Headers

To manage headers, there is a `HeaderBag` object that will have all needed methods to better handle with headers.

## Samples

## Changelog

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file for information about all code changes.

## Testing the code

This library uses the PHPUnit. We carry out tests of all the main classes of this application.

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

> You must always run tests with PHP 7.2 and greater.
